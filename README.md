<b>Unreal Engine 4 Melee Combat System (aka Open Saber Project)</b>

<b>Target Platform:</b> PC (Windows and Linux)

<i>This is an open source project created by and for JK fans in an attempt to re-create the multiplayer melee combat in the Jedi Knight series of games using a modern game engine (UE4).</i>

<i>The main goal of this project is to create a full featured multiplayer (client/dedicated server) melee combat game using Unreal Engine 4.</i>

<i>This project is NOT meant to be a one-to-one remake of Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy, but as mentioned above, it focuses on the combat systems of those games.  Specifically, a free-flowing sword melee and movement system (including acrobatics) which may be used in any setting.</i>

This project is currently in the prototype stage.  For multiplayer, it has a very basic menu system for the client to connect to a dedicated server via IP address (local host or Internet).  Basic movement and combat are implemented using animations (mostly) from Jedi Outcast.  In short, there is still a lot of work to be done.

How to Contribute
-
The project is currently built using Unreal Engine 4 (version 4.16.2).  In the near future it will be updated to the latest engine version (currently 4.18).

This prototype is almost exclusively done using UE4’s blueprint system (so no C++ is required). 

<b>1)</b> Download UE4 (version 4.16).

<b>2)</b> Clone the "develop" branch of this repo (https://github.com/ClydeFrog68/MCS.git) to a local directory of your choice.

<b>3)</b> Launch the UE4 editor, select "Browse..". and choose the "MCS.uproject" file from the cloned directory.

<b>4)</b> Once inside the editor in the top toolbar -> source control (second from left), choose Git for source control and then "connect to source control".

Any contribution(s) would be welcome.  Character models, animations, maps (levels), props, sounds, music, AI bots, anything.  If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.  I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.
