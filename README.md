<b>Unreal Engine 4 Melee Combat System (aka Open Saber Project)</b>

<b>Target Platform:</b> PC (Windows and Linux)

<i>This is an open source project created by and for JK fans in an attempt to re-create the multiplayer melee combat in the Jedi Knight series of games using a modern game engine (UE4).</i>

<i>The main goal of this project is to create a full featured multiplayer (client/dedicated server) melee combat game using Unreal Engine 4.</i>

<i>This project is NOT meant to be a one-to-one remake of Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy, but as mentioned above, it focuses on the combat systems of those games.  Specifically, a free-flowing sword melee and movement system (including acrobatics) which may be used in any setting.</i>

This project is currently in the prototype stage.  For multiplayer, it has a very basic menu system for the client to connect to a dedicated server via IP address (local host or Internet).  Basic movement and combat are implemented using animations (mostly) from Jedi Outcast.  In short, there is still a lot of work to be done.

Please view the develop branch readme for more details.
